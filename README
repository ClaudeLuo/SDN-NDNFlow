SDN-NDNFlow
===========

NDNFlow offers POX and CCNx plugins to enable Information Centric Networking (a.k.a. Named Data Networking) in OpenFlow networks using CCNx, POX and Open vSwitch.

When using NDNFlow please refer to the accompanying article:
Niels L. M. van Adrichem and Fernando A. Kuipers, NDNFlow: Software-Defined Named Data Networking, IEEE Conference on Network Softwarization (IEEE NetSoft), London, UK, April 13-17, 2015
http://www.nas.ewi.tudelft.nl/people/Fernando/papers/NDNflow.pdf

The installation process and usage of NDNFlow is divided in two switch- and controller-specific READMEs, which can be found in the subfolders CCNx and POX.
